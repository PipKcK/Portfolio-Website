## What is Quantum Computing?

At its core, quantum computing harnesses the unique properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. While classical computers use bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

## Key Concepts

### Superposition
Superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states at once, enabling quantum computers to process vast amounts of information simultaneously. This property is fundamental to the power of quantum computing.

### Entanglement
Quantum entanglement creates correlations between qubits, allowing changes to one qubit to instantly affect another, regardless of the distance between them. This property is essential for quantum algorithms and quantum communication.
