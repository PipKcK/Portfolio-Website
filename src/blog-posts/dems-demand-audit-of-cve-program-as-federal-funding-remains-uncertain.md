## The CVE Program Under Scrutiny

### Funding Uncertainties Prompt Congressional Action
In light of ongoing uncertainties regarding federal funding for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, two Congressional Democrats are urging a thorough review of this critical cybersecurity initiative. In a formal letter to the Comptroller General of the United States, House Homeland Security Committee member Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and House Science, Space, and Technology Committee member Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) have called upon the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate how the program is managed.

### Importance of CVE Data
The CVE program, which is vital for both government and private sector cybersecurity efforts, saw its federal funding expire in April. Although the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) managed to secure temporary funds to sustain operations for eleven months, lawmakers are concerned that the flow of essential cybersecurity data may soon come to a halt. Thompson and Lofgren emphasized the need for an assessment of the “efficiency and effectiveness” of related government programs that support the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the CVE initiative. They note, “Cybersecurity remains one of the greatest challenges facing our nation.”

### Investigative Focus
The lawmakers have specifically requested the GAO to evaluate programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that are integral to vulnerability management, such as the NVD and the CVE program itself. They also wish to understand how much both public and private entities depend on these resources for their cybersecurity strategies.

## Budget Cuts and Impacts on CISA

### Recent Budget Proposals
The current administration has proposed significant budget cuts to CISA, raising alarms among cybersecurity stakeholders. Although the planned cuts for the 2026 fiscal year have been reduced to $135 million—much less than the initial $495 million—Democrats argue that even this amount is excessively high for such a crucial agency.

### Leadership Changes and Concerns
Recent months have seen several senior leaders depart from CISA, raising further concerns about the agency's stability and effectiveness. With ongoing budget constraints and leadership turnover, the future of vital cybersecurity programs, including the CVE initiative, remains uncertain.

## Emerging Cybersecurity Threats

### New Vulnerabilities Discovered
In the realm of cybersecurity threats, researchers have identified a critical cross-site scripting vulnerability in the open-source webmail platform Roundcube, known as CVE-2024-42009. This flaw, which has a CVSS score of 9.3, allows remote attackers to exploit desanitization issues, potentially stealing and sending emails from victims' accounts. It affects Roundcube versions 1.5.7 and 1.6.x up to 1.6.7.

### Discord Exploits on the Rise
Additionally, cybercriminals are exploiting flaws in the popular chat application Discord. Research from Check Point has uncovered that invite links, intended to expire after a certain time, can be reused maliciously by attackers to redirect users to sites that install remote access trojans and other malware. To mitigate risks, Discord admins are advised to use invite links set to never expire.

## Data Breaches and Cyber Attacks

### McLean Mortgage Data Breach
In a concerning development, the McLean Mortgage Company has notified over 30,000 customers about a data breach that occurred in October 2024. The company delayed informing affected individuals until a thorough investigation was completed in mid-May. The breach may have compromised sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers and financial data.

### Account Takeover Campaigns
Researchers at Proofpoint have reported a campaign targeting Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) accounts, leveraging the TeamFiltration pentesting tool. Attackers have been observed executing user-enumeration and password-spraying attempts, successfully breaching around 80,000 accounts across various organizations.

## Innovative Attack Methods

### Obfuscation Techniques in JavaScript
In a recent twist on website injection tactics, Palo Alto Networks has highlighted a campaign utilizing advanced JavaScript obfuscation to conceal malicious code within over 269,552 webpages. Using a technique called JSF*ck, the malicious code is disguised in a manner that makes it particularly difficult to detect, although standard defenses against website injections may still provide some protection.

As cybersecurity threats evolve, the importance of programs like CVE becomes increasingly critical. The ongoing scrutiny and potential funding cuts raise pressing questions about the future of vulnerability management in the face of rising digital threats.
